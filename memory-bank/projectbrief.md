# EEG Flutter App - Project Brief

## Overview
A Flutter application that serves as an interface for an EEG (Electroencephalography) measuring device. The app receives real-time EEG data via UDP network protocol and provides real-time visualization of brainwave patterns.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **UDP Data Reception**: Receive EEG data streams via UDP protocol
2. **Real-time Visualization**: Display EEG waveforms in real-time
3. **Data Processing**: Process incoming EEG data for visualization
4. **Cross-platform**: Work on mobile devices (iOS/Android) and desktop platforms

### Technical Requirements
1. **Network Communication**: UDP socket implementation for data reception
2. **Data Visualization**: Real-time charting/graphing capabilities
3. **Performance**: Handle high-frequency data streams without lag
4. **Data Management**: Efficient buffering and processing of continuous data streams

## Success Criteria
- Successfully receives UDP data packets from EEG device
- Displays clear, real-time EEG waveforms
- Maintains smooth performance during continuous data reception
- Provides intuitive user interface for monitoring EEG data

## Target Platforms
- Primary: Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Secondary: Mobile (iOS/Android)

## Current Status
- Fresh Flutter project created
- Default template code in place
- Ready for development planning
