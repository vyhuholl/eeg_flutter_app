# Product Context - EEG Flutter App

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
EEG devices generate continuous streams of brainwave data that need to be visualized in real-time for:
- Medical monitoring and diagnostics
- Research applications  
- Brain-computer interface development
- Neurofeedback applications

### Solution
A Flutter-based mobile/desktop application that:
- Connects to EEG devices via UDP network protocol
- Provides real-time visualization of EEG signals
- Offers a clean, intuitive interface for monitoring brainwave patterns

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Connection**: App connects to EEG device over network (UDP)
2. **Data Reception**: Continuous stream of EEG data received
3. **Visualization**: Real-time display of waveforms/signals
4. **Monitoring**: Users can observe brainwave patterns in real-time

### Key Features
- **Real-time Charting**: Live EEG waveform display
- **Multi-channel Support**: Display multiple EEG channels simultaneously
- **Data Streaming**: Continuous UDP data reception
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth rendering of high-frequency data

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Real-time Responsiveness**: No noticeable delay between data reception and display
- **Clear Visualization**: Easy-to-read EEG waveforms with proper scaling
- **Stable Connection**: Reliable UDP data reception without dropouts
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple, clean UI focused on data visualization

### Secondary Goals
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Work seamlessly across mobile and desktop
- **Customizable Display**: Options to adjust visualization parameters
- **Data Export**: Ability to save or export EEG data
- **Connection Status**: Clear indication of device connection status

## Success Metrics
- Stable data reception at device sampling rate
- Smooth visualization without frame drops
- Intuitive user interface requiring minimal learning
- Cross-platform functionality
