## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Fixed the EEG chart time window that was broken during previous modifications, restoring proper 120-second time window display with relative time starting from 0 when "Подключить устройство" is clicked. Additionally fixed the root cause of showing only 1 second of data by correcting the data filtering logic. Finally, added explicit X-axis range control to force the chart to show exactly the 120-second window instead of auto-scaling. Most critically, eliminated the data buffer access limit that was restricting the chart to only 100 samples. The ultimate root cause was identified and fixed: the buffer size was insufficient (1000 samples) to store 120 seconds of data at the 250Hz sample rate, providing only 4 seconds of storage capacity.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Connection Start Time Tracking** ✅
   - Added `connectionStartTime` getter to `UDPReceiver` class
   - Made connection start time accessible through `ConnectionProvider`
   - Connection start time is set when UDP connection is established
   - Provides foundation for relative time calculations

2. **Relative Time Calculation** ✅
   - Modified EEG chart to use `Consumer2<EEGDataProvider, ConnectionProvider>`
   - Updated chart data calculation to use relative time: `sample.absoluteTimestamp.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds.toDouble()`
   - Both main and meditation chart modes now use relative time for X-axis coordinates
   - Eliminated large timestamp values (like 3388 seconds) from display

3. **X-axis Display Fix** ✅
   - Updated bottom titles interval from 10000ms to 10 seconds
   - Fixed X-axis labels to show simple relative time: `${seconds}s`
   - Updated grid lines vertical interval to match new time scale
   - Fixed tooltip time display to show relative seconds

4. **Data Filtering Logic Fix** ✅
   - Fixed the root cause of showing only 1 second of data
   - Updated filtering logic to show all data since connection start (if < 120 seconds)
   - Or show last 120 seconds of data (if > 120 seconds since connection)
   - Applied fix to both main and meditation chart modes

5. **X-axis Range Control Fix** ✅
   - Added explicit minX and maxX to LineChartData to control visible time window
   - Created XAxisRange class for X-axis range management
   - Implemented _calculateXAxisRange method for dynamic window calculation
   - Forces chart to show exactly 120-second window instead of auto-scaling

6. **Data Buffer Access Fix** ✅
   - Fixed `getLatestJsonSamples()` method to return all available data instead of limiting to 100 samples
   - Updated `processJsonSample()` to stream all buffer data instead of limiting to 100 samples
   - Eliminates artificial data truncation that was causing loss of historical data
   - Ensures complete session data is available for chart visualization

7. **Buffer Size Fix (Root Cause)** ✅
   - Identified that 1000-sample buffer could only hold 4 seconds of data at 250Hz sample rate
   - Increased buffer size from 1000 to 30,000 samples (120 seconds × 250 samples/second)
   - Updated both default buffer size in EEGConfig constructor and defaultConfig factory
   - Removed redundant time-based filtering from data processor that was causing conflicts
   - Ensures complete 120-second data retention within buffer

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Connection Start Time Architecture**:
```dart
// UDPReceiver provides connection start time
DateTime? get connectionStartTime => _connectionStartTime;

// ConnectionProvider exposes it to UI
DateTime? get connectionStartTime => _udpReceiver.connectionStartTime;

// EEGChart consumes both providers for access
Consumer2<EEGDataProvider, ConnectionProvider>(
  builder: (context, eegProvider, connectionProvider, child) {
    final connectionStartTime = connectionProvider.connectionStartTime;
    // Use for relative time calculations
  }
)
```

**Relative Time Calculation**:
```dart
// All chart data now uses relative time
final relativeTimeSeconds = sample.absoluteTimestamp.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds.toDouble();

// Focus line (moving average)
focusData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, average));

// Relaxation line (alpha/beta ratio)
relaxationData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, relaxationValue));

// Meditation lines (BTR, ATR, GTR ratios)
btrData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, sample.beta / sample.theta));
```

**X-axis Display Restoration**:
```dart
// Fixed bottom titles
bottomTitles: AxisTitles(
  sideTitles: SideTitles(
    interval: 10, // 10 seconds (relative time)
    getTitlesWidget: (value, meta) {
      final seconds = value.toInt();
      return Text('${seconds}s'); // Shows: 0s, 10s, 20s, etc.
    },
  ),
),

// Fixed grid lines
FlGridData(
  verticalInterval: 10, // 10 seconds (relative time)
)

// Fixed tooltips
getTooltipItems: (touchedSpots) {
  final seconds = spot.x.toInt();
  final timeStr = '${seconds}s'; // Shows: "25s"
}
```

**Data Filtering Logic Fix**:
```dart
// NEW: Proper data filtering logic
final now = DateTime.now();
final timeSinceConnection = now.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds;

final cutoffTime = timeSinceConnection > 120 
    ? now.millisecondsSinceEpoch - (120 * 1000)  // Show last 120 seconds
    : connectionStartTime.millisecondsSinceEpoch; // Show all data since connection
    
final recentSamples = jsonSamples.where((sample) => 
  sample.absoluteTimestamp.millisecondsSinceEpoch >= cutoffTime).toList();
```

**X-axis Range Control Fix**:
```dart
// FINAL: X-axis range control for 120-second window
class XAxisRange {
  final double min;
  final double max;
  const XAxisRange({required this.min, required this.max});
}

XAxisRange _calculateXAxisRange(DateTime? connectionStartTime) {
  if (connectionStartTime == null) {
    return const XAxisRange(min: 0, max: 120);
  }

  final now = DateTime.now();
  final timeSinceConnection = now.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds.toDouble();
  
  if (timeSinceConnection <= 120) {
    // Show from connection start to current time
    return XAxisRange(min: 0, max: timeSinceConnection.clamp(10, 120));
  } else {
    // Show sliding 120-second window
    return XAxisRange(min: timeSinceConnection - 120, max: timeSinceConnection);
  }
}

// Applied to LineChartData
return LineChartData(
  lineBarsData: lineChartData,
  minX: xAxisRange.min,
  maxX: xAxisRange.max,
  minY: yAxisRange.min,
  maxY: yAxisRange.max,
  // ... other settings
);
```

**Data Buffer Access Fix**:
```dart
// CRITICAL: Fixed data buffer access in DataProcessor
/// Get latest JSON samples (defaults to all available data up to 120 seconds worth)
List<EEGJsonSample> getLatestJsonSamples([int? count]) {
  if (count != null) {
    return _jsonBuffer.getLatest(count);
  }
  
  // If count not specified, return all available data (limited by buffer size)
  // This ensures we get the maximum available data for the time window
  return _jsonBuffer.getAll();
}

/// Process a JSON EEG sample
void processJsonSample(EEGJsonSample sample) {
  _jsonBuffer.add(sample);
  _updateEEGTimeSeriesData(sample);
  _processedJsonDataController.add(_jsonBuffer.getAll()); // Changed from getLatest(100)
}
```

**Buffer Size Fix (Root Cause)**:
```dart
// ROOT CAUSE: Buffer size calculation
// Previous (Broken): 1000 samples
// At 250Hz: 1000 ÷ 250 = 4 seconds of data maximum

// Fixed: 30,000 samples  
// At 250Hz: 30,000 ÷ 250 = 120 seconds of data

/// Configuration for EEG data collection
class EEGConfig {
  const EEGConfig({
    required this.sampleRate,
    required this.deviceAddress,
    required this.devicePort,
    this.bufferSize = 30000, // Default to 120 seconds at 250Hz (120 * 250 = 30,000)
  });

  factory EEGConfig.defaultConfig() {
    return const EEGConfig(
      sampleRate: 250,
      deviceAddress: '0.0.0.0',
      devicePort: 2000,
      bufferSize: 30000, // 120 seconds * 250 samples/second = 30,000 samples
    );
  }
}

/// Update EEG time series data for JSON samples
void _updateEEGTimeSeriesData(EEGJsonSample sample) {
  final timestamp = sample.absoluteTimestamp.millisecondsSinceEpoch.toDouble();
  _eegTimeSeriesData.add(FlSpot(timestamp, sample.eegValue));
  
  // Limit the size to prevent unbounded growth (keep same number as buffer)
  if (_eegTimeSeriesData.length > _config.bufferSize) {
    _eegTimeSeriesData.removeAt(0);
  }
}
```

**Time Window Behavior Comparison**:

**Before Fix (Broken)**:
- **Data Display**: Only ~1 second of data visible
- **X-axis Values**: 3388s, 3398s, 3408s (confusing large numbers)
- **Time Reference**: Absolute system time (meaningless to user)
- **Chart Scaling**: Auto-scaling compressed all data to look like 1 second
- **Data Buffer**: Limited to 100 samples (~10 seconds max)
- **Buffer Capacity**: 1000 samples = 4 seconds maximum at 250Hz
- **User Experience**: Broken, unusable time navigation

**After Complete Fix**:
- **Data Display**: Full data window visible (up to 120 seconds)
- **X-axis Values**: 0s, 10s, 20s, 30s, ..., 120s (clear progression)
- **Time Reference**: Relative to connection start (meaningful to user)
- **Chart Scaling**: Fixed 120-second window, no auto-scaling
- **Data Buffer**: All available buffer data accessible (up to 30,000 samples)
- **Buffer Capacity**: 30,000 samples = 120 seconds at 250Hz
- **User Experience**: Intuitive, professional time navigation

**Data Window Behavior**:
```
Connection Timeline:
0-30 seconds    → Shows all data from 0s to current time
30-60 seconds   → Shows all data from 0s to 60s  
60-120 seconds  → Shows all data from 0s to 120s
120+ seconds    → Shows sliding 120-second window (e.g., 60s to 180s)

Data Filtering Logic:
If time_since_connection ≤ 120 seconds:
  Show all data from connection start
  X-axis: 0s to current_time

If time_since_connection > 120 seconds:
  Show last 120 seconds of data
  X-axis: (current_time - 120s) to current_time

X-axis Range Control:
Chart View Window:
minX = 0, maxX = current_time (if ≤ 120s)
minX = current_time - 120, maxX = current_time (if > 120s)

Forces chart to show exactly this window regardless of data range

Buffer Capacity Analysis:
Previous (Broken):
- Buffer Size: 1000 samples
- Sample Rate: 250 Hz
- Data Capacity: 1000 ÷ 250 = 4 seconds maximum
- Chart Access: getLatestJsonSamples() returned only 100 samples (0.4 seconds)
- Result: Chart could never show more than 4 seconds of data

Current (Fixed):
- Buffer Size: 30,000 samples
- Sample Rate: 250 Hz
- Data Capacity: 30,000 ÷ 250 = 120 seconds
- Chart Access: getLatestJsonSamples() returns all buffer data (up to 30,000 samples)
- Result: Chart can display full 120-second sessions as intended
```

**Example Usage Flow**:
```
1. User clicks "Подключить устройство" → Connection starts → connectionStartTime recorded
2. First data arrives → X-axis shows 0s, chart shows 1 data point in 0-10s window
3. After 30 seconds → X-axis shows 0s to 30s, chart shows all 30 seconds of data in 0-30s window
4. After 2 minutes → X-axis shows 0s to 120s, chart shows all 120 seconds of data in 0-120s window
5. After 3 minutes → X-axis shows 60s to 180s, chart shows sliding 120-second window
6. Throughout session → All data in buffer (up to 30,000 samples) accessible for visualization
7. Buffer retention → Guarantees 120 seconds of data storage at 250Hz sample rate
```

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**The EEG chart time window has been completely restored to proper functionality, displaying complete data windows (up to 120 seconds) with intuitive relative time starting from 0 when the device connection is established, eliminating the confusing large timestamp values, fixing the critical data filtering issue that was showing only the last second of data, adding explicit X-axis range control to force the chart to show exactly the 120-second window instead of auto-scaling to compress all data, eliminating the data buffer access limit that was artificially restricting the chart to only 100 samples, and most fundamentally, increasing the buffer size from 1000 to 30,000 samples to provide adequate storage capacity for 120 seconds of data at the 250Hz sample rate.**

### Key Achievements:
1. **Time Window Restoration**: Chart now properly displays complete data windows instead of just 1 second, showing all available data
2. **Relative Time Display**: X-axis starts at 0s when connection begins and progresses naturally (0s, 10s, 20s, etc.)
3. **Connection-Based Reference**: Time is relative to connection start, not system time, providing meaningful user context
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Fix applied uniformly to both main and meditation screen charts
5. **Professional Display**: Clean, readable time axis with proper grid lines and tooltips enhances application quality
6. **User-Friendly Navigation**: Eliminates confusion from large timestamp values (like 3388s) with intuitive progression
7. **Data Filtering Accuracy**: Fixed root cause of showing only 1 second by correcting filtering logic
8. **X-axis Range Control**: Chart forced to show exactly 120-second window, preventing auto-scaling compression
9. **Complete Data Access**: Eliminated artificial 100-sample limit, ensuring all buffer data is available for visualization
10. **Buffer Size Adequacy**: Increased storage capacity from 4 seconds to 120 seconds (root cause resolution)

### Technical Benefits:
- **Data Integrity**: Complete data windows properly maintained and displayed as originally intended
- **Reference Accuracy**: Time reference tied to connection start ensures consistent, predictable behavior across sessions
- **Visual Clarity**: Clean relative time display eliminates user confusion from large, meaningless timestamp values
