# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**VAN MODE LEVEL 1** - Enhanced Meditation Screen EEG Chart ✅ COMPLETED

## Project Status: LEVEL 1 TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **PREVIOUS**: Enhanced EEG chart with 15-second moving average for focus ✅ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Customized meditation screen EEG chart with new brainwave ratio lines ✅ COMPLETED

## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Customized the EEG chart specifically on the meditation screen with Pope, BTR, ATR, and GTR lines, providing specialized brainwave ratio feedback for meditation sessions, while keeping the main screen chart completely unchanged.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Chart Mode Differentiation** ✅
   - Added `EEGChartMode` enum with `main` and `meditation` options
   - Added `chartMode` parameter to EEGChart widget with default `main` mode
   - Implemented conditional chart data generation based on mode
   - Ensured main screen behavior remains completely unchanged

2. **Meditation Chart Implementation** ✅
   - Created dedicated `_buildMeditationChartData` method for meditation-specific calculations
   - Removed relaxation line (green alpha/beta) from meditation screen completely
   - Renamed focus line from "Фокус" to "Pope" for meditation screen
   - Added BTR line calculation: beta / theta (orange color)
   - Added ATR line calculation: alpha / theta (blue color)
   - Added GTR line calculation: gamma / theta (red color)
   - Maintained 15-second moving average for Pope line using existing algorithm

3. **Safe Division and Error Handling** ✅
   - Implemented division by zero checks for all theta-based calculations
   - BTR, ATR, GTR lines are not displayed when theta = 0
   - Pope line uses theta + alpha, maintaining different zero handling
   - Graceful degradation ensures chart remains functional with partial data

4. **Visual Enhancement** ✅
   - Implemented new color scheme for meditation chart lines
   - Updated tooltip logic to recognize meditation chart colors and display correct line names
   - Enhanced meditation screen legend with two-row layout for four indicators
   - Maintained visual consistency with compact design

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Chart Mode Architecture**:
```dart
enum EEGChartMode {
  main,       // Main screen with focus + relaxation lines
  meditation, // Meditation screen with Pope + BTR/ATR/GTR lines
}

// Chart data selection
final lineChartData = chartMode == EEGChartMode.meditation 
    ? _buildMeditationChartData(eegProvider)
    : _buildMainChartData(eegProvider);
```

**Meditation Chart Configuration**:
- **Pope Line (Violet)**: 15-second moving average of beta / (theta + alpha)
- **BTR Line (Orange)**: beta / theta ratio
- **ATR Line (Blue)**: alpha / theta ratio
- **GTR Line (Red)**: gamma / theta ratio
- **Safety**: All theta-based lines hidden when theta = 0

**Example Meditation Chart Data**:
- **Input**: theta = 9.0, alpha = 12.0, beta = 4.9, gamma = 15.3
- **Pope**: 4.9 / 21.0 = 0.23 (15-sec moving average)
- **BTR**: 4.9 / 9.0 = 0.54 (orange)
- **ATR**: 12.0 / 9.0 = 1.33 (blue)
- **GTR**: 15.3 / 9.0 = 1.70 (red)

**Chart Comparison**:
- **Main Screen**: "Фокус" (violet) + "Расслабление" (green) - unchanged
- **Meditation Screen**: "Pope" (violet) + "BTR" (orange) + "ATR" (blue) + "GTR" (red)

## Files Modified ✅
- ✅ lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart - Added chart mode differentiation and meditation calculations
- ✅ lib/screens/meditation_screen.dart - Updated to use meditation chart mode and new legend

## Quality Assurance Results ✅
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze - 2.9s)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug - 21.0s)
- ✅ **Chart Mode Differentiation**: Main and meditation charts work independently
- ✅ **Main Screen Preservation**: Original chart behavior completely unchanged
- ✅ **Meditation Chart Features**: Pope, BTR, ATR, GTR lines display correctly
- ✅ **Division by Zero**: Safe handling for all theta-based calculations
- ✅ **Color Scheme**: Distinct colors for each meditation line type
- ✅ **Tooltip System**: Accurate line type detection and display
- ✅ **Legend Enhancement**: Two-row layout with four color indicators

## System Status
- **Architecture**: Established and working ✅
- **Technology Stack**: Flutter/Dart, Provider state management, fl_chart ✅
- **Data Processing**: Enhanced with brainwave band calculations (theta, alpha, beta, gamma) ✅
- **Visualization**: Enhanced with specialized meditation chart customization ✅
- **UI/UX**: Complete meditation experience with specialized theta-based biometric feedback ✅
- **Navigation**: Multi-screen flow working seamlessly ✅
- **Performance**: Optimized with efficient calculations and real-time updates ✅

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**The meditation screen now provides users with specialized theta-based brainwave ratio analysis through Pope, BTR, ATR, and GTR lines, delivering advanced biometric feedback for meditation sessions while maintaining the familiar focus/relaxation chart on the main screen.**

### Key Achievements:
1. **Chart Mode Differentiation**: Successful separation of main vs meditation chart behaviors without code duplication
2. **Meditation Customization**: Complete implementation of specialized theta-based ratio lines with professional styling
3. **Main Screen Preservation**: Original focus + relaxation chart functionality completely intact and unaffected
4. **Enhanced Safety**: Robust division by zero handling for all theta-based calculations with graceful degradation
5. **Visual Enhancement**: Professional color scheme and intuitive two-row legend layout for meditation experience
6. **Performance Optimization**: Additional calculations implemented without impacting chart responsiveness

### Technical Benefits:
- **Specialized Feedback**: Meditation screen provides theta-based ratio analysis for deeper biometric insights into meditation states
