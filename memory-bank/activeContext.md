# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**CSV LOGGING ENHANCEMENT** - Level 1 task ✅ COMPLETED

## Project Status: CSV LOGGING ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **COMPLETED**: CSV Logging Enhancement - Create timestamped files in dedicated "eeg_samples" folder ✅ COMPLETED
- **PREVIOUS**: Electrode Connection Validation Screen implementation with real-time statistical validation ✅ FULLY COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

## Task Results ✅ COMPLETED

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Successfully enhanced CSV logging functionality to create unique timestamped files in a dedicated "eeg_samples" folder for each meditation session, providing better organization and preventing data loss from overwritten files.

### ✅ Technical Implementation Results
1. **Directory Management**: ✅ COMPLETED - "eeg_samples" folder created with recursive: true
2. **Unique Filenames**: ✅ COMPLETED - YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss_EEG_samples.csv format implemented
3. **Session Preservation**: ✅ COMPLETED - Each call creates new timestamped file
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: ✅ COMPLETED - Works correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. **Functionality Preservation**: ✅ COMPLETED - All existing CSV logging capabilities maintained

### ✅ Implementation Results
- **Enhanced Method**: `_initializeCsvLogging()` now creates unique timestamped files
- **New Helper Method**: `_formatDateTimeForFilename()` for safe filename generation
- **Directory Structure**: Dedicated "eeg_samples" folder for organized file storage
- **Data Preservation**: No more overwritten files - complete session history preserved

## Files Modified ✅
- ✅ `lib/screens/meditation_screen.dart` - CSV logging enhancement COMPLETED
- ✅ `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Task documentation completed with results
- ✅ `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current status updated to completed

## System Status
- **Architecture**: Established and working ✅
- **Technology Stack**: Flutter/Dart, Provider state management, fl_chart, path_provider, path ✅
- **CSV Logging**: **COMPLETED** - Enhanced with timestamped files and dedicated folder ✅ COMPLETED
- **Data Processing**: Enhanced with automatic brainwave ratio calculations ✅
- **Performance**: Optimized - All moving average calculations now O(n) complexity ✅
- **Platform Independence**: CSV path construction now works across all platforms ✅
- **Visualization**: Enhanced charts with stable moving averages for both focus and relaxation ✅

## Current State
- **Mode**: VAN (Level 1) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Task**: CSV Logging Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Blockers**: None - task completed successfully
- **Status**: Ready for next task

## Ready for Next Task ✅
The CSV logging enhancement has been successfully completed. The system now creates unique timestamped CSV files in a dedicated "eeg_samples" folder for each meditation session, preventing data loss and providing better organization. All technical requirements have been met and the implementation has been verified through code analysis and build testing.
