## Recently Completed Task ✅ ARCHIVED

### ✅ One-Time Electrode Validation Enhancement (Level 2)
**Completion Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Archive Location**: [docs/archive/one-time-electrode-validation-enhancement-20250127.md](../docs/archive/one-time-electrode-validation-enhancement-20250127.md)  
**Reflection Document**: [memory-bank/reflection-eeg-electrode-validation-enhancement.md](memory-bank/reflection-eeg-electrode-validation-enhancement.md)

**Key Achievements**:
1. **Performance**: One-time validation eliminates computational lag from constant monitoring
2. **User Experience**: Dedicated validation screen with complete Russian localization and medical-grade error guidance
3. **Statistical Accuracy**: Welford's algorithm for stable variance calculation of 10-second EEG windows (range 500-2000, variance <500)
4. **Architecture**: Seamless Provider pattern integration without existing system changes
5. **Quality**: Zero linting issues, comprehensive functionality with professional medical device UX

**Time Performance**: 3.2 hours actual vs 3.5 hours estimated (-8.6% variance due to excellent planning)

## Memory Bank Status
