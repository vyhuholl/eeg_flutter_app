## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Implemented a new setup instructions screen that appears before everything else when the app is launched. The screen displays device setup instructions with an image showing proper headset placement, and only proceeds to configuration file creation and application launch after the user clicks "Продолжить".

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Setup Instructions Screen Widget** ✅
   - **Created**: New `SetupInstructionsScreen` widget with black background and responsive layout
   - **Top Text**: "Включите устройство и закрепите его на голове при помощи эластичной ленты, как на картинке:"
   - **Image Display**: Shows `assets/images/EasyEEGBCI_Headlayout_face.png` with proper device placement
   - **Bottom Text**: "Как только будете готовы, нажмите "Продолжить""
   - **Continue Button**: "Продолжить" button to proceed to next stage

2. **App Launch Flow Modification** ✅
   - **Priority Change**: Modified `EEGApp` to show `SetupInstructionsScreen` first instead of `SplashScreen`
   - **Navigation**: Implemented smooth transition from setup screen to existing splash screen
   - **Preservation**: All existing functionality preserved after user continues
   - **User Control**: Application only proceeds when user clicks continue button

3. **Image Integration** ✅
   ```dart
   // Device placement image with error handling
   Container(
     constraints: const BoxConstraints(
       maxWidth: 400,
       maxHeight: 400,
     ),
     child: Image.asset(
       'assets/images/EasyEEGBCI_Headlayout_face.png',
       fit: BoxFit.contain,
       errorBuilder: (context, error, stackTrace) {
         return Container(
           width: 300,
           height: 300,
           decoration: BoxDecoration(
             border: Border.all(color: Colors.white54),
             borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
           ),
           child: const Center(
             child: Text(
               'Изображение недоступно',
               style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white54),
             ),
           ),
         );
       },
     ),
   )
   ```

4. **Button Functionality** ✅
   ```dart
   // Continue button with proper navigation
   ElevatedButton(
     onPressed: () {
       Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
         MaterialPageRoute(
           builder: (context) => const SplashScreen(),
         ),
       );
     },
     style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
       backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
       foregroundColor: Colors.white,
       padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 40, vertical: 15),
       shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
         borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
       ),
     ),
     child: const Text(
       'Продолжить',
       style: TextStyle(
         fontSize: 16,
         fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
       ),
     ),
   )
   ```

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Updated Launch Sequence**:
- **Step 1**: Setup Instructions Screen (NEW) - Shows device setup instructions with image
- **Step 2**: User Action (NEW) - User clicks "Продолжить" button when ready
- **Step 3**: Configuration file creation - Creates EasyEEG_BCI.conf in current directory
- **Step 4**: Executable extraction - Extracts EasyEEG_BCI.exe to app data directory  
- **Step 5**: Executable launch - Launches the EasyEEG_BCI.exe application
- **Step 6**: Window detection - Waits for EasyEEG BCI window to open
- **Step 7**: App navigation - Proceeds to main application screen

**Screen Design Benefits**:
- **Visual Guidance**: Clear image showing proper EEG headset placement
- **User Pacing**: Users control when to proceed, eliminating rushed device setup
- **Professional Appearance**: Consistent design language with existing application screens
- **Error Prevention**: Proper setup instructions reduce likelihood of incorrect device usage

- **User Experience**: Clear error messaging in Russian language

### ✅ Previous Task: Configuration File Creation Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

Enhanced the application launch sequence to automatically create an "EasyEEG_BCI.conf" file in the current directory (where eeg_flutter_app.exe is located) before launching EasyEEG_BCI.exe. The file is created with contents from assets/EasyEEG_BCI.conf and will overwrite any existing file.

**Configuration File Benefits**:
- **Automatic Setup**: Configuration file ready before external application starts
- **Fresh Configuration**: File overwritten on each launch ensuring clean state
- **Current Directory**: File created where Flutter executable is located as requested
