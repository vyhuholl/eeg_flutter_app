# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**VAN MODE LEVEL 1** - EEG Chart Time Window Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

## Project Status: LEVEL 1 TASK COMPLETED
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **COMPLETED**: Chart enhancement for 120-second time window with 10-second intervals

## Current Task: EEG Chart Time Window Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
**VAN MODE LEVEL 1:**
- Task Type: Quick Enhancement
- Complexity: Level 1
- Mode: VAN (no need for PLAN/CREATIVE modes)
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Modified EEG chart to show data for the last 120 seconds instead of current time window

### ✅ Secondary Objective COMPLETED
Updated time axis to show markings every 10 seconds for better readability

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Chart Configuration** ✅
   - Modified time window from 500ms to 10,000ms intervals
   - Updated time axis interval markings to 10-second increments
   - Enhanced time labels to show relative seconds

2. **Data Management** ✅
   - Implemented time-based data filtering for 120-second window
   - Enhanced data provider with time-based cleanup
   - Maintained data collection and processing efficiency

3. **Performance Verification** ✅
   - Chart renders smoothly with time-based filtering
   - Build test successful with no compilation errors
   - Memory optimization through time-based data cleanup

## Files Modified ✅
- ✅ lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart - Chart time axis and intervals
- ✅ lib/services/data_processor.dart - Time-based data filtering

## Quality Assurance ✅
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues (flutter analyze)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful (flutter build web --debug)
- ✅ **Implementation**: All requirements met

## System Status
- **Architecture**: Established and working ✅
- **Technology Stack**: Flutter/Dart, Provider state management, fl_chart ✅
- **Data Processing**: Enhanced with 120-second time window ✅
- **Visualization**: Enhanced with 10-second intervals ✅
- **Performance**: Optimized with time-based data management ✅

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**The EEG chart now successfully displays the last 120 seconds of data with clear 10-second interval markings, providing improved long-term trend visualization for EEG monitoring.**

### Key Achievements:
1. **Time Window**: Extended from ~1000 points to exactly 120 seconds
2. **Intervals**: Changed from 0.5-second to 10-second markings
3. **Performance**: Optimized data management with time-based filtering
4. **User Experience**: Enhanced readability with relative time labels

## Current State
- **Mode**: VAN Level 1 ✅ COMPLETED
- **Next**: Ready for new task or verification
- **Blockers**: None - task completed successfully
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSFUL
