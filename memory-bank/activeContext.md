# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - Administrator Privilege Check Implementation completed

## Project Status: ADMINISTRATOR SECURITY ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **COMPLETED**: Administrator Privilege Check Implementation - Level 1 critical security fix ✅ COMPLETED

## Current Task: Administrator Privilege Check Implementation

### ✅ Implementation Phase COMPLETED

**Issue Resolved**: ✅ COMPLETED
- App required administrator privileges before launching EasyEEG_BCI.exe
- Need to check privileges BEFORE everything else in app startup
- Display specific Russian error message if not running as administrator
- Completely block app functionality until proper privileges obtained

**Technical Solution Implemented**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Administrator Check First**: Added `AdministratorCheckScreen` as very first screen in app flow
- **PowerShell Detection**: PowerShell-based privilege checking using WindowsPrincipal role membership
- **Russian Error Message**: Exact text as requested with security icon and close button
- **Complete Blocking**: No app functionality available until administrator privileges confirmed
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, graceful handling on other platforms

**Implementation Achieved**:
- ✅ Administrator privilege verification before all other app operations
- ✅ Russian error message exactly as requested with proper styling
- ✅ Complete app blocking when not running as administrator
- ✅ Clean integration into app initialization flow without breaking existing functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging

### Technical Context
- **Location**: `lib/main.dart` with new `AdminPrivilegeChecker` class and `AdministratorCheckScreen`
- **Security Method**: PowerShell WindowsPrincipal role membership check
- **App Flow**: AdministratorCheckScreen → SetupInstructionsScreen → SplashScreen → MainScreen
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure assumes non-administrator for security
- **Verification**: Clean code analysis with no issues found

### User Experience Improvement
- **Security First**: Critical security check happens before any app operations
- **Clear Guidance**: Exact Russian instructions for running as administrator
- **Professional Interface**: Red security icon with proper error styling
- **Complete Protection**: EasyEEG_BCI.exe launch prevented until proper privileges
- **Easy Recovery**: Simple close button allows restart with proper privileges

## Memory Bank Status
- **Tasks**: Administrator privilege check documented and completed
- **Progress**: Task implementation complete, quality assurance passed
- **Active Context**: Administrator security enhancement successfully resolved
- **Architecture**: Stable EEG system with enhanced security at startup

## Available Actions
- **Ready for New Task**: Available for next VAN mode task
- **Verification**: User can test administrator privilege checking behavior
- **Quality Assurance**: All tests passed, no code analysis issues found

## System Capabilities (Current State)
- ✅ **Administrator Security Check**: Mandatory privilege verification before app operations ✅ NEW
- ✅ **Real-time EEG Data Processing**: 100Hz UDP data with efficient visualization
- ✅ **Electrode Validation**: One-time statistical validation with Russian localization  
- ✅ **State Management**: Robust Provider pattern with multi-provider dependencies
- ✅ **User Interface**: Material Design with professional medical device UX
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive scenarios with user-friendly guidance
- ✅ **Debug Support**: Conditional debug information and CSV export capabilities
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized data flow with throttling and efficient algorithms
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Russian localization framework established
- ✅ **Navigation**: Multi-screen flow with conditional routing based on validation state
- ✅ **Windows Integration**: Security bypass for EasyEEG_BCI.exe launch with admin check
- ✅ **Logging Management**: Enhanced file lifecycle preventing storage bloat

## Architecture Notes
The security system now implements mandatory administrator privilege checking at application startup, ensuring the EEG application has necessary permissions for Windows Defender bypass and EasyEEG_BCI.exe launch operations. The check happens before all other operations and completely blocks functionality when insufficient privileges are detected.
