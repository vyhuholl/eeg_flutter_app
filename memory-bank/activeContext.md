## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Enhanced the green "Расслабление" line on the EEG chart to display a 10-second moving average of RAB (alpha/beta) values, exactly matching the behavior of the violet "Фокус" line. Both lines now provide stable, smoothed biometric feedback suitable for professional meditation applications.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Moving Average Algorithm** ✅
   - **Created**: `_calculateRelaxationMovingAverage` method using O(n) sliding window algorithm
   - **Applied**: 10-second moving average to RAB values for stable relaxation visualization
   - **Optimized**: Identical performance characteristics to focus line algorithm
   - **Consistency**: Matching mathematical approach and error handling

2. **Chart Data Integration** ✅
   ```dart
   // Updated main chart data building
   final focusData = _calculateFocusMovingAverage(recentSamples, connectionStartTime);
   final relaxationData = _calculateRelaxationMovingAverage(recentSamples, connectionStartTime); // NEW
   ```

3. **Algorithm Specifications** ✅
   - **Time Window**: 10 seconds (10,000 milliseconds) matching focus line
   - **Complexity**: O(n) sliding window for optimal real-time performance
   - **Invalid Value Handling**: Skips RAB = 0.0 samples (division by zero protection)
