# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**VAN MODE LEVEL 1** - Enhanced EEG Chart with Brainwave Ratios ✅ COMPLETED

## Project Status: LEVEL 1 TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **PREVIOUS**: Enhanced EEG data processing with brainwave band calculations (theta, alpha, beta, gamma) ✅ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Modified EEG chart to display brainwave ratio calculations ✅ COMPLETED

## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Modified the EEG chart to display scientifically meaningful brainwave ratio calculations instead of raw EEG values, providing users with real-time biometric feedback based on calculated brainwave band relationships.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Chart Data Source Replacement** ✅
   - Replaced raw eegValue data usage with brainwave band calculations
   - Modified `_buildDualLineChartData` method to access EEGJsonSample objects directly
   - Implemented 120-second time window filtering for brainwave ratio data
   - Maintained chart performance with efficient data processing

2. **Brainwave Ratio Calculations** ✅
   - Implemented relaxation calculation: `alpha / beta`
   - Implemented focus calculation: `beta / (theta + alpha)`
   - Both calculations performed in real-time during chart data generation
   - Accurate ratio calculations using precise floating-point arithmetic

3. **Safe Division Implementation** ✅
   - Added zero-value checks for beta denominator (relaxation line)
   - Added zero-value checks for theta + alpha denominator (focus line)
   - Dynamic line creation - only adds lines when valid data exists
   - Graceful handling ensures chart remains responsive with partial data

4. **Chart Integration Enhancement** ✅
   - Updated chart to access brainwave band data from EEGDataProvider
   - Maintained existing chart styling (violet for focus, green for relaxation)
   - Enhanced tooltip logic to handle dynamic line indices based on color
   - Preserved all existing chart functionality and visual appearance

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Enhanced Chart Calculations**:
```dart
// Focus line: beta / (theta + alpha) - hide if theta + alpha = 0
final thetaAlphaSum = sample.theta + sample.alpha;
if (thetaAlphaSum != 0.0) {
  final focusValue = sample.beta / thetaAlphaSum;
  focusData.add(FlSpot(timestamp, focusValue));
}

// Relaxation line: alpha / beta - hide if beta = 0
if (sample.beta != 0.0) {
  final relaxationValue = sample.alpha / sample.beta;
  relaxationData.add(FlSpot(timestamp, relaxationValue));
}
```

**Example Real-time Calculations**:
- **Input**: theta = 9.0, alpha = 12.0, beta = 4.9
- **Relaxation**: alpha / beta = 12.0 / 4.9 = 2.45
- **Focus**: beta / (theta + alpha) = 4.9 / 21.0 = 0.23

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Beta = 0: No green line (relaxation) displayed
- Theta + alpha = 0: No violet line (focus) displayed
- Both denominators = 0: Empty chart displayed gracefully
