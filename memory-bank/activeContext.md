## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Enhanced the meditation screen EEG chart visualization by making all lines thinner (reduced from 2.0 to 1.0 pixels) and ensuring the Pope line appears on top of all other lines for better visibility and focus during meditation sessions.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Line Thickness Optimization** ✅
   - **Change**: Reduced `barWidth` from 2.0 to 1.0 pixels for all meditation chart lines
   - **Impact**: Provides cleaner, more refined visual appearance
   - **Benefit**: Reduces visual clutter while maintaining data readability

2. **Visual Layer Ordering** ✅
   - **Bottom Layer**: BTR line (orange) - Beta/Theta ratio
   - **Middle Layer**: ATR line (blue) - Alpha/Theta ratio  
   - **Upper Layer**: GTR line (red) - Gamma/Theta ratio
   - **Top Layer**: Pope line (violet) - Primary focus indicator

3. **Drawing Order Implementation** ✅
   ```dart
   // Previous order (Pope line appeared below other lines)
   // 1. Pope line → drawn first (bottom)
   // 2. BTR line → drawn second
   // 3. ATR line → drawn third
   // 4. GTR line → drawn fourth (top)
   
   // New order (Pope line appears on top of all other lines)
   // 1. BTR line → drawn first (bottom)
   // 2. ATR line → drawn second
   // 3. GTR line → drawn third
   // 4. Pope line → drawn fourth (top)
   ```

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Visual Hierarchy Benefits**:
- **Pope Line Prominence**: Primary meditation focus indicator now clearly visible above all other metrics
- **Reduced Visual Noise**: Thinner lines create cleaner, more professional appearance
- **Better Data Interpretation**: Users can easily distinguish the key focus metric from supplementary ratios
- **Enhanced Meditation Experience**: Clear visual priority helps users focus on the most important biometric feedback

**Meditation Application Benefits**:
- **Enhanced Biofeedback**: Pope line clearly visible as the main meditation indicator
- **Supporting Metrics**: BTR, ATR, GTR provide context without overwhelming the primary signal
- **Visual Clarity**: Thinner lines reduce distraction while maintaining data accuracy
- **Professional Appearance**: Refined visualization suitable for therapeutic applications

### ✅ Previous Task: CSV Path Platform-Independence Fix ✅ COMPLETED

Fixed the platform-dependent path construction in the `_initializeCsvLogging` method by replacing string interpolation with forward slashes with the proper `path.join()` method, ensuring the CSV file path works correctly across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Cross-Platform Compatibility Benefits**:
- **Proper Separators**: Automatically uses correct path separator for each platform
- **Best Practices**: Follows Dart/Flutter recommended approach for path construction
- **Reliability**: Eliminates potential path-related issues across different operating systems
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code that follows platform-independence guidelines

## Files Modified ✅
- ✅ lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart - Updated meditation chart line configuration and drawing order
- ✅ memory-bank/tasks.md - Documented meditation screen chart line enhancements implementation
- ✅ memory-bank/activeContext.md - Updated current status

## Quality Assurance Results ✅
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze - 1.1s)
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Pope line now appears on top of all other lines
- ✅ **Line Thickness**: All lines reduced to 1.0 pixel width for cleaner appearance
- ✅ **Functionality**: All existing chart functionality preserved
- ✅ **Chart Mode**: Changes only affect meditation screen, main screen unchanged
- ✅ **User Experience**: Enhanced visual clarity and focus for meditation biofeedback

## System Status
