### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Class Structure Enhancement** ✅

3. **Division by Zero Protection** ✅
   ```dart
   double btr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : beta / theta;
   double atr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : alpha / theta;
   double pope = (theta == 0.0 && alpha == 0.0) ? 0.0 : beta / (theta + alpha);
   double gtr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : gamma / theta;
   double rab = beta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : alpha / beta;
   ```

4. **Constructor Updates** ✅
   - Updated all EEGJsonSample constructor calls throughout codebase

- **Purpose**: Attention and focus measurement
- **Usage**: Higher BTR indicates increased cognitive engagement
- **Application**: Direct access for meditation screen chart visualization

**ATR (Alpha/Theta Ratio)**:
- **Purpose**: Relaxation depth analysis
- **Usage**: Higher ATR indicates awake relaxation vs deep meditative states
- **Application**: Immediate availability for meditation screen chart

**Pope (Beta/(Theta+Alpha))**:
- **Purpose**: Primary focus indicator already used in charts
- **Usage**: Now available directly without recalculation
- **Application**: Optimized circle animation and focus line calculations

**GTR (Gamma/Theta Ratio)**:
- **Purpose**: High-frequency cognitive activity measurement
- **Usage**: Indicates complex cognitive processing
- **Application**: Enhanced meditation screen chart with gamma activity

**RAB (Alpha/Beta Ratio)**:
- **Purpose**: Relaxation vs attention balance
- **Usage**: Already used in main chart relaxation line
- **Application**: Simplified chart calculations without manual ratio computation

### ✅ Chart Visualization Optimization

**Before Enhancement (Manual Calculations)**:
```dart
// Repeated calculations in chart widgets
double popeValue = (sample.theta + sample.alpha) == 0 ? 0.0 : sample.beta / (sample.theta + sample.alpha);
double relaxationValue = sample.beta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : sample.alpha / sample.beta;
double btrValue = sample.theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : sample.beta / sample.theta;
```

**After Enhancement (Direct Access)**:
```dart
// Direct access to pre-calculated ratios
double popeValue = sample.pope;
double relaxationValue = sample.rab;
double btrValue = sample.btr;
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Ratios calculated once during JSON parsing instead of repeatedly in UI
- **Cleaner Code**: Chart widgets access pre-calculated values directly
- **Consistent Values**: Same ratio values used across all visualizations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Values stored efficiently in sample objects

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Enhanced Class Structure**:
```dart
class EEGJsonSample {
  final double timeDelta;
  final double eegValue;
  final DateTime absoluteTimestamp;
  final int sequenceNumber;
  final double theta;
  final double alpha;
  final double beta;
  final double gamma;
  final double btr;    // beta / theta (0 if theta is 0)
  final double atr;    // alpha / theta (0 if theta is 0)
  final double pope;   // beta / (theta + alpha) (0 if theta + alpha is 0)
  final double gtr;    // gamma / theta (0 if theta is 0)
  final double rab;    // alpha / beta (0 if beta is 0)
}
```

**Automatic Calculation in fromMap**:
```dart
// Calculate brainwave ratios with division by zero protection
double btr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : beta / theta;
double atr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : alpha / theta;
double pope = (theta == 0.0 && alpha == 0.0) ? 0.0 : beta / (theta + alpha);
double gtr = theta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : gamma / theta;
double rab = beta == 0.0 ? 0.0 : alpha / beta;

return EEGJsonSample(
  // ... existing fields ...
  btr: btr,
  atr: atr,
  pope: pope,
  gtr: gtr,
  rab: rab,
);
```

**Enhanced Serialization**:
```dart
Map<String, dynamic> toJson() {
  return <String, dynamic>{
    'd': timeDelta,
    'E': eegValue,
    'theta': theta,
    'alpha': alpha,
    'beta': beta,
    'gamma': gamma,
    'btr': btr,

    'pope': pope,
    'gtr': gtr,
    'rab': rab,

    'sequenceNumber': sequenceNumber,
  };
}
```
