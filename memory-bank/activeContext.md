## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Enhanced the violet "Фокус" line on the EEG chart to display a 15-second moving average of beta / (theta + alpha) calculations, providing users with smoother, more stable focus measurements during meditation sessions.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Moving Average Algorithm Implementation** ✅
   - Created dedicated `_calculateFocusMovingAverage` method for focus line processing
   - Implemented 15-second sliding window (15,000 milliseconds) for data collection
   - Applied moving average calculation using arithmetic mean of values within window
   - Maintained efficient processing for real-time chart updates

2. **Chart Data Generation Enhancement** ✅
   - Modified `_buildDualLineChartData` method to use moving average for focus line
   - Separated focus and relaxation line calculations for improved code clarity
   - Preserved existing relaxation line logic (alpha / beta) without any changes
   - Enhanced focus line with smoothed, stable measurements

3. **Safe Division and Error Handling** ✅
   - Maintained division by zero checks for theta + alpha in moving average calculation
   - Graceful handling of samples with invalid denominators (skipped from calculations)
   - Proper window boundary handling for samples near beginning of data stream
   - Robust error handling ensures chart remains functional with partial data

4. **Performance Optimization** ✅
   - Efficient moving average calculation without significant performance impact
   - Smart data filtering within time windows to minimize computational overhead
   - Preserved real-time chart updates and responsiveness
   - Added necessary imports for proper type resolution

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Enhanced Moving Average Calculation**:
```dart
List<FlSpot> _calculateFocusMovingAverage(List<EEGJsonSample> samples) {
  // 15-second sliding window implementation
  const movingAverageWindowMs = 15 * 1000;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < samples.length; i++) {
    // Collect focus values from 15-second window
    final windowStartTime = currentTimestamp - movingAverageWindowMs;
    final focusValues = <double>[];
    
    // Calculate moving average from window data
    if (focusValues.isNotEmpty) {
      final average = focusValues.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / focusValues.length;
      focusData.add(FlSpot(currentTimestamp, average));
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Moving Average Effect**:
- **Raw Focus Values**: 0.23, 0.25, 0.21, 0.27, 0.24, 0.20, 0.26... (noisy)
- **15-second Moving Average**: 0.24, 0.24, 0.24... (smooth, stable)
- **Result**: Noise-reduced, reliable focus measurements

**Chart Behavior Enhancement**:
- **Focus Line (Violet)**: Now displays 15-second moving average of beta / (theta + alpha)
- **Relaxation Line (Green)**: Unchanged alpha / beta calculation (immediate response)
- **Visual Result**: Smoother focus line with reduced fluctuations
