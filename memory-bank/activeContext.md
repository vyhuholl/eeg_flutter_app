# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**VAN MODE LEVEL 1** - Enhanced EEG Chart Time Window Fix ✅ COMPLETED

## Project Status: LEVEL 1 TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **PREVIOUS**: Added circle animation that responds to Pope value changes ✅ COMPLETED
- **COMPLETED**: Fixed EEG chart time window to show proper 120-second relative time display ✅ COMPLETED
- **ADDITIONAL**: Fixed data filtering logic to show complete data window instead of just last second ✅ COMPLETED

## Task Results ✅

### ✅ Primary Objective COMPLETED
Fixed the EEG chart time window that was broken during previous modifications, restoring proper 120-second time window display with relative time starting from 0 when "Подключить устройство" is clicked. Additionally fixed the root cause of showing only 1 second of data by correcting the data filtering logic.

### ✅ Technical Implementation COMPLETED

1. **Connection Start Time Tracking** ✅
   - Added `connectionStartTime` getter to `UDPReceiver` class
   - Made connection start time accessible through `ConnectionProvider`
   - Connection start time is set when UDP connection is established
   - Provides foundation for relative time calculations

2. **Relative Time Calculation** ✅
   - Modified EEG chart to use `Consumer2<EEGDataProvider, ConnectionProvider>`
   - Updated chart data calculation to use relative time: `sample.absoluteTimestamp.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds.toDouble()`
   - Both main and meditation chart modes now use relative time for X-axis coordinates
   - Eliminated large timestamp values (like 3388 seconds) from display

3. **X-axis Display Fix** ✅
   - Updated bottom titles interval from 10000ms to 10 seconds
   - Fixed X-axis labels to show simple relative time: `${seconds}s`
   - Updated grid lines vertical interval to match new time scale
   - Fixed tooltip time display to show relative seconds

4. **Data Filtering Logic Fix** ✅
   - Fixed the root cause of showing only 1 second of data
   - Updated filtering logic to show all data since connection start (if < 120 seconds)
   - Or show last 120 seconds of data (if > 120 seconds since connection)
   - Applied fix to both main and meditation chart modes

### ✅ Implementation Results

**Connection Start Time Architecture**:
```dart
// UDPReceiver provides connection start time
DateTime? get connectionStartTime => _connectionStartTime;

// ConnectionProvider exposes it to UI
DateTime? get connectionStartTime => _udpReceiver.connectionStartTime;

// EEGChart consumes both providers for access
Consumer2<EEGDataProvider, ConnectionProvider>(
  builder: (context, eegProvider, connectionProvider, child) {
    final connectionStartTime = connectionProvider.connectionStartTime;
    // Use for relative time calculations
  }
)
```

**Relative Time Calculation**:
```dart
// All chart data now uses relative time
final relativeTimeSeconds = sample.absoluteTimestamp.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds.toDouble();

// Focus line (moving average)
focusData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, average));

// Relaxation line (alpha/beta ratio)
relaxationData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, relaxationValue));

// Meditation lines (BTR, ATR, GTR ratios)
btrData.add(FlSpot(relativeTimeSeconds, sample.beta / sample.theta));
```

**X-axis Display Restoration**:
```dart
// Fixed bottom titles
bottomTitles: AxisTitles(
  sideTitles: SideTitles(
    interval: 10, // 10 seconds (relative time)
    getTitlesWidget: (value, meta) {
      final seconds = value.toInt();
      return Text('${seconds}s'); // Shows: 0s, 10s, 20s, etc.
    },
  ),
),

// Fixed grid lines
FlGridData(
  verticalInterval: 10, // 10 seconds (relative time)
)

// Fixed tooltips
getTooltipItems: (touchedSpots) {
  final seconds = spot.x.toInt();
  final timeStr = '${seconds}s'; // Shows: "25s"
}
```

**Data Filtering Logic Fix**:
```dart
// NEW: Proper data filtering logic
final now = DateTime.now();
final timeSinceConnection = now.difference(connectionStartTime).inSeconds;

final cutoffTime = timeSinceConnection > 120 
    ? now.millisecondsSinceEpoch - (120 * 1000)  // Show last 120 seconds
    : connectionStartTime.millisecondsSinceEpoch; // Show all data since connection
    
final recentSamples = jsonSamples.where((sample) => 
  sample.absoluteTimestamp.millisecondsSinceEpoch >= cutoffTime).toList();
```

**Time Window Behavior Comparison**:

**Before Fix (Broken)**:
- **Data Display**: Only ~1 second of data visible
- **X-axis Values**: 3388s, 3398s, 3408s (confusing large numbers)
- **Time Reference**: Absolute system time (meaningless to user)
- **User Experience**: Broken, unusable time navigation

**After Fix (Restored)**:
- **Data Display**: Full data window visible (up to 120 seconds)
- **X-axis Values**: 0s, 10s, 20s, 30s, ..., 120s (clear progression)
- **Time Reference**: Relative to connection start (meaningful to user)
- **User Experience**: Intuitive, professional time navigation

**Data Window Behavior**:
```
Connection Timeline:
0-30 seconds    → Shows all data from 0s to current time
30-60 seconds   → Shows all data from 0s to 60s  
60-120 seconds  → Shows all data from 0s to 120s
120+ seconds    → Shows sliding 120-second window (e.g., 60s to 180s)

Data Filtering Logic:
If time_since_connection ≤ 120 seconds:
  Show all data from connection start
  X-axis: 0s to current_time

If time_since_connection > 120 seconds:
  Show last 120 seconds of data
  X-axis: (current_time - 120s) to current_time
```

**Example Usage Flow**:
```
1. User clicks "Подключить устройство" → Connection starts → connectionStartTime recorded
2. First data arrives → X-axis shows 0s, chart shows 1 data point
3. After 30 seconds → X-axis shows 0s to 30s, chart shows all 30 seconds of data
4. After 2 minutes → X-axis shows 0s to 120s, chart shows all 120 seconds of data
5. After 3 minutes → X-axis shows 60s to 180s, chart shows sliding 120-second window
```

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETION SUMMARY

**The EEG chart time window has been fully restored to proper functionality, displaying complete data windows (up to 120 seconds) with intuitive relative time starting from 0 when the device connection is established, eliminating both the confusing large timestamp values and the critical data filtering issue that was showing only the last second of data.**

### Key Achievements:
1. **Time Window Restoration**: Chart now properly displays complete data windows instead of just 1 second, showing all available data
2. **Relative Time Display**: X-axis starts at 0s when connection begins and progresses naturally (0s, 10s, 20s, etc.)
3. **Connection-Based Reference**: Time is relative to connection start, not system time, providing meaningful user context
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Fix applied uniformly to both main and meditation screen charts
5. **Professional Display**: Clean, readable time axis with proper grid lines and tooltips enhances application quality
6. **User-Friendly Navigation**: Eliminates confusion from large timestamp values (like 3388s) with intuitive progression
7. **Data Filtering Accuracy**: Fixed root cause of showing only 1 second by correcting filtering logic

### Technical Benefits:
- **Data Integrity**: Complete data windows properly maintained and displayed as originally intended
- **Reference Accuracy**: Time reference tied to connection start ensures consistent, predictable behavior across sessions
- **Visual Clarity**: Clean relative time display eliminates user confusion from large, meaningless timestamp values
- **Chart Consistency**: Both chart modes (main/meditation) use identical time window logic for uniform experience
- **Performance Preservation**: Fix maintains all existing chart performance, responsiveness, and real-time update capabilities
- **Architecture Improvement**: Enhanced provider pattern with connection start time tracking
- **Filtering Accuracy**: Data filtering now correctly shows all available data within the intended time window

### User Experience Enhancement:
- **Intuitive Time Navigation**: Users can easily track meditation progress and data trends from connection start
- **Complete Data Visibility**: All available data history visible as intended for comprehensive analysis (not just last second)
- **Clear Timeline Reference**: No more confusing large timestamp values; time progression makes immediate sense
