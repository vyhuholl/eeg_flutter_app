## Project Status: READY FOR NEXT DEVELOPMENT TASK
- Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking implementation
- Real-time data processing and visualization system
- Provider-based state management with multi-channel support
- Full architecture matching documented system patterns
- **LATEST COMPLETED**: CSV File Compression Enhancement - Level 2 simple enhancement archived ✅

## Recently Completed
- CSV File Compression Enhancement (Level 2) is now complete. Archive: [csv-compression-enhancement-20250127.md](../docs/archive/csv-compression-enhancement-20250127.md)

## Current Focus
- Ready for new task assignment via VAN mode

### Task Availability
- Memory Bank is reset and ready for new development task
- Use VAN mode to initialize next task analysis and complexity determination
- All previous task documentation preserved in archive for future reference

## Memory Bank Status
- **Tasks**: CSV compression enhancement fully archived and documented
- **Progress**: Latest completion milestone recorded with archive reference
- **Active Context**: Reset and ready for new task assignment
- **Architecture**: Stable EEG system with enhanced CSV compression functionality

## Available Actions
- **New Task**: Ready for VAN mode to analyze and initialize next development task
- **Archive**: ✅ COMPLETED - Comprehensive archive document created with full documentation
- **System Status**: All Memory Bank files updated and ready for next development cycle

## System Capabilities (Current State)
- ✅ **Real-time EEG Data Processing**: 100Hz UDP data with efficient visualization
- ✅ **CSV Logging**: Optimized buffered system creating timestamped files in organized directory
- ✅ **Electrode Validation**: One-time statistical validation with Russian localization  
- ✅ **State Management**: Robust Provider pattern with multi-provider dependencies
- ✅ **User Interface**: Material Design with professional medical device UX
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive scenarios with user-friendly guidance
- ✅ **Debug Support**: Conditional debug information and CSV export capabilities
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized data flow with throttling and efficient algorithms
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Russian localization framework established
- ✅ **Navigation**: Multi-screen flow with conditional routing based on validation state
- ✅ **Windows Integration**: Security bypass for EasyEEG_BCI.exe launch with admin check
- ✅ **Logging Management**: Enhanced file lifecycle preventing storage bloat
- ✅ **CSV Compression**: Automatic GZIP compression reduces 5GB CSV files to ~1GB (81.3% compression ratio) ✅ NEW

## Architecture Notes
The EEG application now includes automatic CSV compression functionality that seamlessly integrates with the existing buffered CSV logging system. The implementation uses the archive package for GZIP compression, achieving 81.3% file size reduction (5GB → ~1GB) while maintaining complete data integrity through verification. Compression is automatically triggered at all session lifecycle points with comprehensive error handling and original file preservation on failure.
