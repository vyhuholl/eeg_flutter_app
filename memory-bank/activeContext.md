# Active Context - EEG Flutter App

## Current Work Focus
**Project Planning Phase** - Designing the architecture and implementation plan for EEG data visualization app

## Recent Context
- Fresh Flutter project created with default template
- Project requirements defined: UDP data reception + real-time EEG visualization
- Memory bank established with project documentation

## Current Task
Creating comprehensive implementation plan for EEG Flutter app including:
1. Technical architecture design
2. Dependency selection and integration
3. Implementation phases and milestones
4. Development workflow planning

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Dependency Selection**: Choose UDP networking and charting libraries
2. **Project Structure**: Define folder structure and file organization
3. **Core Components**: Plan implementation of main components
4. **Development Phases**: Break down implementation into manageable phases

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **UDP Library Choice**: 
   - Option A: Native `dart:io` Socket
   - Option B: Third-party UDP library (e.g., `udp`)
   - **Consideration**: Performance vs. ease of use

2. **Charting Library Choice**:
   - Option A: `fl_chart` (popular, good performance)
   - Option B: `syncfusion_flutter_charts` (feature-rich, commercial)
   - Option C: Custom painting (maximum performance)
   - **Consideration**: Performance vs. development time

3. **State Management**:
   - Option A: `provider` (simple, well-integrated)
   - Option B: `riverpod` (more features, better testing)
   - Option C: `bloc` (complex but powerful)
   - **Consideration**: Complexity vs. features needed

### Implementation Approach
- **Phase 1**: Basic UDP reception and data parsing
- **Phase 2**: Simple visualization with static data
- **Phase 3**: Real-time data streaming and visualization
- **Phase 4**: UI polish and advanced features

## Key Considerations
- **Performance**: Real-time data processing is critical
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on mobile and desktop
- **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface
- **Reliability**: Stable UDP data reception

## Questions to Address
1. What is the expected EEG data format from the device?
2. How many channels need to be displayed simultaneously?
3. What sampling rate should we expect?
4. Are there specific visualization requirements (colors, scaling, etc.)?

## Current State
- **Mode**: Planning
- **Next**: Implementation planning and dependency selection
- **Blockers**: None identified
- **Ready**: For detailed implementation planning
