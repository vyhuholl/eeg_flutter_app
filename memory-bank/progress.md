# Progress - EEG Flutter App

## Current Status: VAN Level 1 - Enhanced EEG Chart with Debug Mode ✅ COMPLETED

### Current Task: EEG Chart Enhancement with Debug Mode Toggle
- Task Type: Level 1 Quick Enhancement
- Mode: VAN (no PLAN/CREATIVE needed)
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Task Objectives
1. **Primary**: Enhance EEG chart size and add legend to meditation screen ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Secondary**: Add debug mode toggle for conditional chart visibility ✅ COMPLETED

### Files Modified
- ✅ lib/screens/meditation_screen.dart - Enhanced EEG chart with legend and debug mode implementation

### Implementation Progress
- [x] Examine current EEG chart configuration and size constraints ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Increase EEG chart dimensions from 200x200 to 350x250 ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create legend component with Focus and Relaxation indicators ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add `isDebugModeOn` boolean variable with default true value ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement conditional rendering using `_buildCenterContent()` method ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test debug mode ON layout (circle + enhanced chart + legend) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test debug mode OFF layout (centered circle only) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Verify responsive design and spacing in both modes ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Ensure all existing functionality preserved ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Final build verification and code analysis ✅ COMPLETED

### What Works (Current Implementation)
- ✅ Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking
- ✅ Real-time data processing and visualization
- ✅ Provider-based state management
- ✅ Multi-channel EEG data support
- ✅ Signal quality assessment
- ✅ EEG chart visualization with fl_chart
- ✅ Clean single-chart layout (power spectrum removed)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ 120-second time window with 10-second intervals
- ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced meditation screen with larger EEG chart (350x250), legend, and debug mode toggle

### Technical Implementation Summary
- **Chart Enhancement**: Increased dimensions from 200x200 to 350x250 (75% larger display area)
- **Legend Integration**: Focus (violet) and Relaxation (green) indicators with Russian labels
- **Debug Mode System**: `isDebugModeOn` boolean controls chart visibility
- **Conditional Rendering**: Clean separation between debug and normal mode layouts
- **Code Organization**: Helper methods (`_buildLegend()`, `_buildCenterContent()`) for maintainability
- **Layout Optimization**: Circle sizing adjusted for both modes (280x280 debug, 400x400 normal)

### Build & Quality Verification
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze - ran in 2.5s)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug - 18.8s)
- ✅ **Chart Enhancement**: 350x250 EEG chart displays properly with legend
- ✅ **Debug Mode Toggle**: Both layout modes render correctly
- ✅ **Functionality**: Timer (5-minute limit), navigation, and all existing features preserved
- ✅ **Data Flow**: EEG chart receives and displays real-time Focus and Relaxation data
- ✅ **Legend Display**: Color-coded indicators match chart lines perfectly

### Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The meditation screen now provides users with flexible visualization options: an enhanced EEG experience with larger chart and legend in debug mode, or a clean circle-focused interface in normal mode, maintaining all existing functionality while offering 75% larger chart visibility for detailed biometric feedback.
