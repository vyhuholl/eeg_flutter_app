# EEG Flutter App - Implementation Progress

## Overall Project Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**Current Status**: VAN Mode Level 1 Task Completed Successfully
**Focus**: Enhanced EEG Chart Time Window Complete Restoration
**Last Update**: EEG Chart Time Window Root Cause Fixed - Buffer Size Increased to Support 120 Seconds

## 🎯 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ COMPLETED: EEG Chart Time Window Complete Restoration 
**Status**: 100% Complete ✅
**Mode**: VAN (Level 1)
**Priority**: Critical (User-Reported Issue)

**Final Resolution Summary**:
The EEG chart time window has been completely restored to proper 120-second functionality through a comprehensive multi-layer fix that addressed all underlying issues from surface symptoms to root cause:

1. **X-axis Display Fix** ✅ - Fixed confusing large timestamps (3388s) to relative time (0s, 10s, 20s)
2. **Data Filtering Logic Fix** ✅ - Corrected filtering that was showing only 1 second of data
3. **X-axis Range Control Fix** ✅ - Added explicit minX/maxX to prevent auto-scaling compression
4. **Data Buffer Access Fix** ✅ - Eliminated 100-sample limit, providing access to all buffer data
5. **Buffer Size Fix (Root Cause)** ✅ - Increased from 1000 to 30,000 samples for 120-second capacity at 250Hz

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Problem**: Buffer size of 1000 samples could only hold 4 seconds at 250Hz sample rate
- **Calculation**: 1000 samples ÷ 250 samples/second = 4 seconds maximum storage
- **Impact**: Chart could never display more than 4 seconds regardless of other fixes
- **Solution**: Increased to 30,000 samples (120 seconds × 250 samples/second = 30,000)
- **Result**: Chart now properly stores and displays full 120-second data windows

**Technical Implementation Results**:
- ✅ Connection start time tracking through ConnectionProvider
- ✅ Relative time calculation from connection start (0s, 10s, 20s, etc.)
- ✅ Proper data filtering logic for 120-second time windows
- ✅ X-axis range control preventing auto-scaling compression
- ✅ Complete buffer data access (all 30,000 samples available)
- ✅ Adequate buffer size for 120 seconds at 250Hz sample rate
- ✅ Applied to both main and meditation screen charts

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `lib/services/udp_receiver.dart` - Connection start time tracking
- ✅ `lib/providers/connection_provider.dart` - Connection start time access
- ✅ `lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart` - Time window, filtering, range control
- ✅ `lib/services/data_processor.dart` - Buffer access and redundant filtering removal
- ✅ `lib/models/eeg_data.dart` - Buffer size from 1000 to 30,000 samples

**Quality Verification**:
- ✅ Code Analysis: No issues (flutter analyze - 1.0s)
- ✅ Build Test: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug)
- ✅ Time Window: Proper 120-second display confirmed
- ✅ Buffer Capacity: 30,000 samples = 120 seconds at 250Hz confirmed
