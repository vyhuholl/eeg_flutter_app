- ✅ EEG chart visualization with fl_chart
- ✅ Clean single-chart layout (power spectrum removed)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ 120-second time window with 10-second intervals
- ✅ Enhanced meditation screen with larger EEG chart (350x250), legend, and debug mode toggle
- ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced EEG data processing with brainwave band calculations (theta, alpha, beta, gamma)

### Technical Implementation Summary

**Enhanced EEGJsonSample Structure**:
- **Existing Fields**: timeDelta, eegValue, absoluteTimestamp, sequenceNumber
- **New Fields**: theta, alpha, beta, gamma (computed brainwave bands)
- **JSON Support**: Extracts 8 new keys (t1, t2, a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, g1)
- **Calculations**: 
  - theta = t1 + t2
  - alpha = a1 + a2
  - beta = b1 + b2 + b3
  - gamma = g1

**Advanced JSON Processing**:
- Added `_parseDoubleWithDefault` helper method for safe parsing
- Graceful handling of missing brainwave data (defaults to 0.0)
- Full backward compatibility with existing 'd' and 'E' fields
- Comprehensive validation for all new fields

**System-wide Updates**:
- Updated all EEGJsonSample constructor calls throughout codebase
- Enhanced data processor filtering to preserve brainwave values
- Updated UDP receiver fallback sample creation
- Maintained all existing chart visualization functionality

### Example Data Processing

**Input JSON**:
```json
{
  "d": 100.5,    // timeDelta (existing)
  "E": 23.7,     // eegValue (existing)
  "t1": 5.2,     // theta component 1
  "t2": 3.8,     // theta component 2
  "a1": 7.1,     // alpha component 1
  "a2": 4.9,     // alpha component 2
  "b1": 2.3,     // beta component 1
  "b2": 1.7,     // beta component 2
  "b3": 0.9,     // beta component 3
  "g1": 12.4     // gamma component
}
```

**Computed Brainwave Bands**:
- theta = 5.2 + 3.8 = 9.0
- alpha = 7.1 + 4.9 = 12.0
- beta = 2.3 + 1.7 + 0.9 = 4.9
- gamma = 12.4

### Build & Quality Verification
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze - 0.9s)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug)
- ✅ **Data Model**: Enhanced EEGJsonSample structure implemented correctly
- ✅ **JSON Parsing**: All 8 new keys extracted and calculated properly
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing timeDelta and eegValue functionality preserved
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing brainwave data
- ✅ **Constructor Consistency**: All EEGJsonSample instances updated throughout codebase

### Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The EEG data processing system now provides comprehensive brainwave band analysis, extracting and calculating theta, alpha, beta, and gamma values from incoming JSON samples while maintaining full backward compatibility and robust error handling.
