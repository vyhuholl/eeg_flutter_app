# Progress - EEG Flutter App

## Current Status: VAN Level 1 - EEG Chart Time Window Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

### Current Task: EEG Chart Time Window Enhancement
- Task Type: Level 1 Quick Enhancement
- Mode: VAN (no PLAN/CREATIVE needed)
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### Task Objectives
1. **Primary**: Modify EEG chart to show last 120 seconds of data ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Secondary**: Update time axis to show 10-second interval markings ✅ COMPLETED

### Files Modified
- ✅ lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart - Updated time axis intervals and labels
- ✅ lib/services/data_processor.dart - Enhanced time-based data filtering

### Implementation Progress
- [x] Examine current EEG chart implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Identify time window configuration parameters ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Modify time window to 120 seconds ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Update time axis intervals to 10 seconds ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Verify data buffer can handle 120-second window ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test chart performance with larger dataset ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test scrolling behavior and data updates ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Final verification and testing ✅ COMPLETED

### What Works (Current Implementation)
- ✅ Flutter project with complete EEG UDP networking
- ✅ Real-time data processing and visualization
- ✅ Provider-based state management
- ✅ Multi-channel EEG data support
- ✅ Signal quality assessment
- ✅ EEG chart visualization with fl_chart
- ✅ Clean single-chart layout (power spectrum removed)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ **NEW**: 120-second time window with 10-second intervals

### Technical Implementation Summary
- **Chart Configuration**: Changed time axis from 500ms to 10,000ms intervals
- **Data Filtering**: Implemented time-based data management for 120-second window
- **Performance**: Optimized with time-based cleanup and safety limits
- **User Experience**: Enhanced time labels showing relative seconds

### Build & Quality Verification
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug) 
- ✅ **Implementation**: All requirements successfully implemented

### Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The EEG chart now displays exactly 120 seconds of data with clear 10-second interval markings, providing better long-term trend visualization for EEG monitoring.
