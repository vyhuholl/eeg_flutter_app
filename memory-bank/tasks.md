# EEG Flutter App - Enhanced Meditation Screen EEG Chart

## LEVEL 1 TASK: Meditation Screen EEG Chart Customization ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Summary
Customized the EEG chart specifically on the meditation screen with new brainwave ratio lines while keeping the main screen chart intact.

### Description
Modified the EEG chart on meditation screen only to display different brainwave ratios:

**Chart Modifications for Meditation Screen:**
- Remove green "Расслабление" (relaxation) line entirely
- Rename violet "Фокус" line to "Pope" 
- Add three new ratio lines with different colors:
  - "BTR" line: `beta / theta`
  - "ATR" line: `alpha / theta`
  - "GTR" line: `gamma / theta`

**Important Constraints:**
- Main screen EEG chart must remain completely unchanged
- If theta = 0, new ratio lines should not be displayed
- Use different colors (not violet) for new lines

### Enhancement Requirements
**Part 1: Chart Mode Differentiation**
- Add parameter to EEGChart widget to differentiate meditation vs main screen usage
- Implement separate chart data generation for meditation screen
- Preserve main screen chart behavior completely unchanged
- Enable meditation-specific chart customizations

**Part 2: Meditation Chart Implementation**
- Remove relaxation line calculation and display
- Rename focus line from "Фокус" to "Pope"
- Add BTR, ATR, GTR line calculations with theta division safety
- Implement new color scheme for additional lines
- Maintain 15-second moving average for Pope line

### Implementation Checklist

### Implementation Details - ✅ COMPLETED

**Chart Mode Differentiation**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Added `EEGChartMode` enum with `main` and `meditation` options
- Added `chartMode` parameter to EEGChart widget with default `main` mode
- Implemented conditional chart data generation based on mode
- Ensured main screen behavior remains completely unchanged

**Meditation Chart Implementation**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Created dedicated `_buildMeditationChartData` method for meditation-specific calculations
- Removed relaxation line (green alpha/beta) from meditation screen completely
- Renamed focus line from "Фокус" to "Pope" for meditation screen
- Added BTR line calculation: beta / theta (orange color)
- Added ATR line calculation: alpha / theta (blue color)
- Added GTR line calculation: gamma / theta (red color)
- Maintained 15-second moving average for Pope line using existing algorithm

**Safe Division and Error Handling**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented division by zero checks for all theta-based calculations
- BTR, ATR, GTR lines are not displayed when theta = 0
- Pope line uses theta + alpha, maintaining different zero handling
- Graceful degradation ensures chart remains functional with partial data

**Visual Enhancement**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented new color scheme for meditation chart lines:
  - Pope: Violet (0xFFBF5AF2) - maintains consistency with focus concept
  - BTR: Orange (0xFFFF9500) - distinct color for beta/theta ratio
  - ATR: Blue (0xFF007AFF) - distinct color for alpha/theta ratio
  - GTR: Red (0xFFFF3B30) - distinct color for gamma/theta ratio
- Updated tooltip logic to recognize meditation chart colors and display correct line names
- Enhanced meditation screen legend with two-row layout for four indicators

### Technical Implementation

**Chart Mode Architecture**:
```dart
enum EEGChartMode {
  main,       // Main screen with focus + relaxation lines
  meditation, // Meditation screen with Pope + BTR/ATR/GTR lines
}

// Chart data selection
final lineChartData = chartMode == EEGChartMode.meditation 
    ? _buildMeditationChartData(eegProvider)
    : _buildMainChartData(eegProvider);
```

**Meditation Chart Calculations**:
```dart
List<LineChartBarData> _buildMeditationChartData(EEGDataProvider eegProvider) {
  // Pope line: 15-second moving average of beta / (theta + alpha)
  final popeData = _calculateFocusMovingAverage(recentSamples);
  
  // Theta-based ratio lines (only if theta != 0)
  for (final sample in recentSamples) {
    if (sample.theta != 0.0) {
      final btrValue = sample.beta / sample.theta;      // BTR
      final atrValue = sample.alpha / sample.theta;     // ATR  
      final gtrValue = sample.gamma / sample.theta;     // GTR
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Meditation Chart Data**:
**Input Brainwave Bands**:
- theta = 9.0, alpha = 12.0, beta = 4.9, gamma = 15.3

**Calculated Meditation Ratios**:
- Pope = beta / (theta + alpha) = 4.9 / 21.0 = 0.23 (15-sec moving average)
- BTR = beta / theta = 4.9 / 9.0 = 0.54 (orange line)
- ATR = alpha / theta = 12.0 / 9.0 = 1.33 (blue line)
- GTR = gamma / theta = 15.3 / 9.0 = 1.70 (red line)

**Edge Case Handling**:
- If theta = 0: BTR, ATR, GTR lines not displayed
- Pope line calculation unaffected (uses theta + alpha)
- Chart remains functional with partial data availability

### Enhanced Tooltip System
**Meditation Chart Tooltips**:
```dart
// Dynamic line type detection based on color and chart mode
if (chartMode == EEGChartMode.meditation) {
  if (spot.bar.color == const Color(0xFFBF5AF2)) lineType = 'Pope';
  else if (spot.bar.color == const Color(0xFFFF9500)) lineType = 'BTR';
  else if (spot.bar.color == const Color(0xFF007AFF)) lineType = 'ATR';
  else if (spot.bar.color == const Color(0xFFFF3B30)) lineType = 'GTR';
}
```

**Meditation Screen Legend**:
- Two-row layout accommodating four indicators
- Pope (violet) + BTR (orange) in first row
- ATR (blue) + GTR (red) in second row
- Maintains visual consistency with compact design

### Files Modified
