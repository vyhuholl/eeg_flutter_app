# EEG Flutter App - Power Spectrum Removal

## LEVEL 1 TASK: Quick Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Summary
Remove all code related to the power spectrum chart. Only EEG chart should remain.

### Description
The application currently has both EEG time series chart and power spectrum chart functionality. The user has requested to remove all power spectrum related code and keep only the EEG chart functionality.

### Enhancement Requirements
- Remove power_spectrum_chart.dart widget file completely
- Remove PowerSpectrumData class and related methods from eeg_data.dart
- Remove PowerSpectrumChart import and usage from main_screen.dart
- Simplify main screen layout to show only EEG chart
- Clean up any unused frequency band analysis code
- Ensure EEG chart continues to work independently

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Remove lib/widgets/power_spectrum_chart.dart file
- [x] Remove PowerSpectrumData class from lib/models/eeg_data.dart
- [x] Remove power spectrum related methods from EEGJsonSample class
- [x] Remove PowerSpectrumChart import from lib/screens/main_screen.dart
- [x] Simplify main screen layout to single EEG chart view
- [x] Remove dual chart layout functionality
- [x] Clean up spectrum references in providers (connection_provider.dart, eeg_data_provider.dart)
- [x] Clean up spectrum references in data_processor.dart
- [x] Test that EEG chart works correctly
