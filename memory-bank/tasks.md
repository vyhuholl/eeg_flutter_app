# EEG Flutter App - Chart Time Window Enhancement

## LEVEL 1 TASK: Quick Enhancement

### Task Summary
Modify EEG chart to show data for the last 120 seconds with 10-second interval markings.

### Description
The EEG chart currently shows a limited time window. The user has requested to extend this to show the last 120 seconds of EEG data and display time axis markings at 10-second intervals for better readability.

### Enhancement Requirements
- Modify EEG chart to display data for the last 120 seconds
- Change time axis to show intervals every 10 seconds
- Ensure chart scrolls/updates smoothly as new data arrives
- Maintain current data visualization quality and performance

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] Examine current EEG chart implementation in lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart
- [x] Identify where time window is configured
- [x] Modify time window to 120 seconds
- [x] Update time axis intervals to 10 seconds
- [x] Ensure data buffer can handle 120 seconds of data
- [x] Test chart performance with larger time window
- [x] Verify chart scrolling behavior

### Implementation Details - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Chart Time Axis**: ✅ UPDATED - Changed interval from 500ms to 10,000ms (10 seconds)
  - Updated bottom axis titles to show 10-second intervals
  - Modified time labels to show relative time (seconds ago) for better readability
  - Updated grid lines to match 10-second intervals
- **Data Processor Enhancement**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced time-based data filtering
  - Added `_timeWindowSeconds = 120` constant for 120-second window
  - Modified `_updateEEGTimeSeriesData()` to remove data older than 120 seconds
  - Updated `eegTimeSeriesData` getter to filter and return only last 120 seconds
  - Maintained safety limit of maximum points as backup
- **Performance Optimization**: ✅ VERIFIED - Chart builds and runs successfully
  - Flutter analyze: No issues found
  - Build test: Successful web build completion
  - Time-based filtering ensures optimal memory usage

### Build Verification
- [x] Code Analysis: ✅ No issues found (Flutter analyze)
- [x] Compilation: ✅ App builds successfully (flutter build web --debug)
- [x] Implementation: ✅ All time window and interval changes applied

### Files Modified
- ✅ lib/widgets/eeg_chart.dart - Updated time axis intervals and labels
- ✅ lib/services/data_processor.dart - Enhanced time-based data filtering

### 🎯 RESULT - TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**The EEG chart now displays data for the last 120 seconds with 10-second interval markings.**

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Time Axis Configuration**: Changed from 0.5-second to 10-second intervals
2. **Data Filtering**: Implemented time-based filtering for 120-second window
3. **Label Enhancement**: Time labels now show relative seconds for better readability
4. **Performance**: Optimized data management with time-based cleanup
5. **Grid Lines**: Updated to match 10-second intervals

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED
### Mode: VAN (Level 1)
### Next: READY FOR VERIFICATION OR NEW TASK
