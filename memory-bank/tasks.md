# EEG Flutter App - Enhanced Data Processing with Brainwave Bands

## LEVEL 1 TASK: Enhanced EEG Data Processing with Brainwave Band Calculations ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Summary
Enhanced the EEG data processing to extract additional JSON keys and calculate brainwave band values (theta, alpha, beta, gamma).

### Description
Modified the data reception and processing system to handle additional JSON sample keys and compute brainwave band values:

**New JSON Keys to Extract:**
- `t1`, `t2` - Theta band components
- `a1`, `a2` - Alpha band components  
- `b1`, `b2`, `b3` - Beta band components
- `g1` - Gamma band component

**Computed Values:**
- `theta` = t1 + t2
- `alpha` = a1 + a2
- `beta` = b1 + b2 + b3
- `gamma` = g1

### Enhancement Requirements
**Part 1: EEGJsonSample Model Enhancement**
- Add theta, alpha, beta, gamma fields to EEGJsonSample class
- Maintain existing timeDelta and eegValue fields
- Update constructors and JSON parsing logic
- Add validation for new fields

**Part 2: JSON Processing Enhancement**
- Extract t1, t2, a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, g1 from incoming JSON
- Compute brainwave band values using specified formulas
- Handle missing or invalid brainwave data gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing 'd' and 'E' fields

### Technical Implementation

**Enhanced JSON Structure Support**:
```json
{
  "d": 100.5,    // timeDelta (existing)
  "E": 23.7,     // eegValue (existing)
  "t1": 5.2,     // theta component 1 (new)
  "t2": 3.8,     // theta component 2 (new)
  "a1": 7.1,     // alpha component 1 (new)
  "a2": 4.9,     // alpha component 2 (new)
  "b1": 2.3,     // beta component 1 (new)
  "b2": 1.7,     // beta component 2 (new)
  "b3": 0.9,     // beta component 3 (new)
  "g1": 12.4     // gamma component (new)
}
```

**Calculated Brainwave Bands**:
- theta = 5.2 + 3.8 = 9.0
- alpha = 7.1 + 4.9 = 12.0
- beta = 2.3 + 1.7 + 0.9 = 4.9
- gamma = 12.4

**Enhanced EEGJsonSample Structure**:
- `timeDelta`: double - Time delta in milliseconds (existing)
- `eegValue`: double - EEG signal value (existing)
- `theta`: double - Theta brainwave band (4-8 Hz)
- `alpha`: double - Alpha brainwave band (8-12 Hz)
- `beta`: double - Beta brainwave band (12-30 Hz)
- `gamma`: double - Gamma brainwave band (30+ Hz)
- `absoluteTimestamp`: DateTime - Absolute timestamp (existing)
- `sequenceNumber`: int - Sample sequence number (existing)

### Files Modified
- ✅ lib/models/eeg_data.dart - Enhanced EEGJsonSample class with brainwave bands
- ✅ lib/services/data_processor.dart - Updated for enhanced data model
- ✅ lib/services/udp_receiver.dart - Updated fallback sample creation

### Quality Assurance Results ✅
- ✅ **Code Analysis**: No issues found (flutter analyze - 0.9s)
- ✅ **Build Test**: Successful compilation (flutter build web --debug)
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing 'd' and 'E' fields still processed correctly
- ✅ **New Field Handling**: Brainwave band fields extracted and calculated properly
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Missing brainwave data defaults to 0.0 safely
