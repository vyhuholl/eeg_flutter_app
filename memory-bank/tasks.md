# EEG Flutter App - Enhanced EEG Chart with Focus Moving Average

## LEVEL 1 TASK: EEG Chart Focus Line Moving Average Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Summary
Enhanced the violet "Фокус" line on the EEG chart to display a 15-second moving average of beta / (theta + alpha) calculations.

### Description
Updated the focus line calculation to use a 15-second moving average for smoother and more stable focus measurements:

**Chart Data Modifications:**
- Green line ("Расслабление" - Relaxation): `alpha / beta` (unchanged)
- Violet line ("Фокус" - Focus): 15-second moving average of `beta / (theta + alpha)`

**Moving Average Implementation:**
- Calculate beta / (theta + alpha) for each sample
- Apply 15-second sliding window average
- Maintain division by zero handling (hide line if theta + alpha = 0)

### Enhancement Requirements
**Part 1: Moving Average Calculation**
- Implement 15-second moving average for focus values
- Maintain real-time calculation performance
- Preserve existing chart styling and behavior
- Keep relaxation line calculation unchanged

**Part 2: Chart Integration**

- Maintain 120-second time window functionality
- Preserve division by zero safety measures
- Ensure smooth chart visualization

### Implementation Checklist

### Technical Implementation

**Moving Average Calculation Logic**:
```dart
List<FlSpot> _calculateFocusMovingAverage(List<EEGJsonSample> samples) {
  final focusData = <FlSpot>[];
  const movingAverageWindowMs = 15 * 1000; // 15 seconds
  
  for (int i = 0; i < samples.length; i++) {
    final currentSample = samples[i];
    final currentTimestamp = currentSample.absoluteTimestamp.millisecondsSinceEpoch.toDouble();
    
    // Skip if division by zero
    final thetaAlphaSum = currentSample.theta + currentSample.alpha;
    if (thetaAlphaSum == 0.0) continue;
    
    // Collect focus values from 15-second window
    final windowStartTime = currentTimestamp - movingAverageWindowMs;
    final focusValues = <double>[];
    
    for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
      final sample = samples[j];
      final sampleTimestamp = sample.absoluteTimestamp.millisecondsSinceEpoch.toDouble();
      
      if (sampleTimestamp >= windowStartTime) {
        final sampleThetaAlphaSum = sample.theta + sample.alpha;
        if (sampleThetaAlphaSum != 0.0) {
          final focusValue = sample.beta / sampleThetaAlphaSum;
          focusValues.add(focusValue);
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Calculate moving average
    if (focusValues.isNotEmpty) {
      final average = focusValues.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / focusValues.length;
      focusData.add(FlSpot(currentTimestamp, average));
    }
  }
  
  return focusData;
}
```

**Example Moving Average Effect**:
**Raw Focus Values (beta / (theta + alpha))**:
- t0: 0.23, t1: 0.25, t2: 0.21, t3: 0.27, t4: 0.24, t5: 0.20, t6: 0.26...

**15-second Moving Average**:
- At t15: Average of [0.23, 0.25, 0.21, 0.27, 0.24, 0.20, 0.26, ...] = 0.24 (smoothed)
- At t16: Average of [0.25, 0.21, 0.27, 0.24, 0.20, 0.26, ...] = 0.24 (stable)
- Reduces noise and provides stable focus measurements
